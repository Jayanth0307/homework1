What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
Both merge and rebase main functions are to integrate changes from one branch to another. However, the way changes are made are different. 
For merge, all the past histories of main branch will not be deleted when integrating changes. However, for rebase history from main
branch will be deleted from when the second branch was created so all the history of main branch will be replaced with the new branch history.
